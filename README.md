## Game Overview

Asterobitus is a 2D space shooter where players control a spaceship navigating through an asteroid field. The objective is to destroy asteroids while avoiding collisions, earning points, and surviving increasingly challenging waves of asteroids.

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Classic Asteroids Mechanics**: Navigate a spaceship through space destroying asteroids
- **Multiple Asteroid Sizes**: Large, medium, and small asteroids with different behaviors
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Asteroid spawn rate increases over time
- **Score System**: Earn points for destroying asteroids, with high score tracking
- **Health System**: Player has multiple lives with invulnerability periods after taking damage

### Weapons System
- **Standard Weapon**: Single projectile with balanced damage and speed
- **Double Shot Weapon**: Fires two projectiles simultaneously with spread pattern
- **Weapon Switching**: Toggle between weapons during gameplay with Q key

### Audio & Visual Effects
- **Sound Effects**: Distinct audio for different asteroid destructions and weapon firing
- **Particle Effects**: Explosion effects for destroyed asteroids and player
- **Screen Shake**: Dynamic camera shake for impact feedback
- **Visual Feedback**: Player invulnerability blinking effect

### Game States
- **Menu System**: Start game, view scores
- **Pause Functionality**: Pause and resume gameplay
- **Game Over Screen**: Final score display and restart options

## How to Play

### Controls

#### Movement
- **W** or **Up Arrow**: Thrust forward
- **A/D** or **Left/Right Arrows**: Rotate spaceship left/right

#### Combat
- **Space** or **Left Mouse Button**: Fire weapon
- **Q**: Switch between Standard and Double Shot weapons

#### Game Management
- **Escape**: Pause/Resume game during gameplay

### Objective
1. **Survive**: Avoid collisions with asteroids
2. **Destroy**: Shoot asteroids to earn points and clear the field
3. **Score**: Achieve the highest score possible

### Scoring System
- **Large Asteroids**: Higher points, split into medium asteroids when destroyed
- **Medium Asteroids**: Moderate points, split into small asteroids when destroyed  
- **Small Asteroids**: Lower points, completely destroyed when hit
- **High Score**: Your best score is automatically saved and displayed

### Gameplay Tips
- Large asteroids require multiple hits and split into smaller ones
- Use the Double Shot weapon for crowd control
- Take advantage of invulnerability periods after taking damage
- The game becomes progressively more difficult with faster spawn rates

## Game Mechanics

### Asteroid Behavior
- **Three Size Categories**: Large, Medium, Small
- **Splitting Mechanics**: Large asteroids split into 2 medium asteroids, medium asteroids split into smaller pieces
- **Variable Health**: Different asteroid sizes have different health values
- **Dynamic Movement**: Asteroids move with physics-based momentum and rotation

### Player Mechanics
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Realistic thrust and momentum system
- **Health System**: Multiple hit points with visual feedback
- **Invulnerability Frames**: Temporary protection after taking damage
- **Screen Wrapping**: Player and asteroids wrap around screen edges

### Weapon Systems
- **Cooldown-Based Firing**: Prevents spam shooting with balanced fire rates
- **Two Weapon Types**:
  - Standard: Single, powerful shots
  - Double Shot: Twin projectiles with spread angle
- **Configurable Parameters**: Speed, damage, and lifetime settings

## Technical Architecture

### Core Systems
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Centralized event system for game state management
- **Factory Pattern**: Asteroid and projectile creation through factory classes
- **Object Pooling**: Efficient memory management for frequently created/destroyed objects
- **Singleton Managers**: Game state, configuration, and score management

### Key Components
- **GameManager**: Handles overall game state transitions
- **ScoreManager**: Tracks and persists player scores  
- **ConfigLoader**: Loads game settings from JSON configuration files
- **AsteroidSpawner**: Manages asteroid creation and difficulty scaling
- **Player System**: Modular player components (Movement, Shooting, Health, Setup)

### Design Patterns Used
- **Component System**: Modular player functionality
- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation management
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven communication
- **Singleton Pattern**: Global manager access
